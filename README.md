## PROJECT NAME = US BIKE-SHARE DATA

<description>: •	Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.
•	Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

### the four question interested are :
•	Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York, or Washington?
•	Would you like to filter the data by month, day, or not at all?
•	(If they chose month) Which month - January, February, March, April, May, or June?
•	(If they chose day) Which day - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday?
